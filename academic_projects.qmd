# Time Series Project

The aim of the TS project is to answer the question : "how Did Covid Affect Seattle Housing's Price?" \

This project examined how the Covid 19 pandemic affected the housing market in Seattle by model building and forecasting.\ 

The model building process involved examining the acf/pacf, also applied a variety of diagnostic checks to the residual to validate and choose the best model.

Forecasted housing prices by applying the best model from created models as if Covid didn't happen, and then compared the forecasted to the actual data to analyze the effects Covid had on Seattle's housing market. Turns out Covid hurt Seattle's housing prices\


# Machine Learning Project
The aim of this project is to predict if an NBA player will be a top 75 player based on their personal information such as height and weight \

This project performed data science techniques such as cross fold validation; utilized various machine learning methods to 5 different classification models : Logistic Regression, KNN, Elastic Net Regression, Random Forrest, Boosted Gradient Tree\

Assessed the model performances through multiple metrics such as the true positive rate, AUC under Roc to choose the best models as random forest and ENR\
